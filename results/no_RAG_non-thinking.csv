"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk_i"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 45%, and set the spacing between core and die as 10 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Place the macros with a bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 32 um,32 um, and the top-right corner as 55 um,60 um. And place each macro at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0 um, and the y-axis as0. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X3 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.0435 and 0.0817, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 2 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M6. ","```python

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 35%, and set the spacing between core and die as 5 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7.

# Looking at the help, there's a -via config entry type. Let's add a general one.
# This setting is tricky without more specific via configuration details.
# A general via setting might not apply specifically to ""parallel grids"".
# A common way is to define via patterns between layers used for grids/rings.
# Let's try adding via configurations between relevant layers (M1-M4, M4-M5, M5-M6, M6-M7, M7-M8)
# with pitch 0 if the layers have parallel directions (v-v or h-h).
# This requires knowing layer directions from the LEF. Without knowing directions,
# we apply a general via config between all adjacent power layers and set pitch 0.
# This might not be exactly what ""pitch of the via between two grids"" means,
# but setting via pitch 0 for parallel layers is a plausible interpretation.

# Define via config between relevant layers with pitch 0
# This assumes layers have default directions from LEF
# M1 (v), M4 (h), M5 (v), M6 (h), M7 (v), M8 (h) - common pattern, but depends on LEF
# Via between M1 and M4 (v-h): standard via
# Via between M4 and M5 (h-v): standard via
# Via between M5 and M6 (v-h): standard via
# Via between M6 and M7 (h-v): standard via
# Via between M7 and M8 (v-h): standard via

# The request ""pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um"" for ""parallel grids""
# is unusual. Via pitches are typically driven by the grid pitch they connect.
# A pitch of 0 means vias are placed very densely or stacked.
# Let's try to configure vias between adjacent power layers with pitch 0.
# This might require defining specific via structures in the LEF.
# The `set_pdn_config -via` syntax is usually `-via -layers {<layer1> <layer2>} -pitch <pitch> -offset <offset>`.
# It doesn't seem to support conditional application to ""parallel grids"" or different pitches for different via stacks.
# A common approach is to define via layers/masters.
# Let's add via configurations for all adjacent layers used in grids/rings (M1, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8)
# and set their pitch to 0. This interprets the request as ""vias connecting these power layers should have 0 pitch"".

# However, the user asked for place_macros *then* set fence. This might imply
# setting the fence *before* global placement if it were a full flow, or using it
# for verification/legalization. Let's define it here as requested.
# The command `set_macro_fence` is not a direct OpenROAD API command in this form.
# Fence regions are typically defined during placement configuration.
# A common way is to define a region and assign macros to it or use placement directives.
# Let's assume the intent is to constrain macro placement during the main placement step.
# This might require a more complex setup involving regions or constraints files.
# Given the direct command request, we will skip a direct `set_macro_fence`
# as it's not a standard single API call in this structure.
# Let's proceed assuming macros are placed and constraints are applied via placement configuration.
# A more direct way to constrain macro location might involve using specific macro placement commands if available
# or using constraints files. For this script, we note the fence requirement but don't implement a command
# that doesn't exist in the direct API style requested.

# Set spacing constraints between macros
# Ensure each macro is at least 5 um away from others
# This is typically part of placement configuration or legalization rules.
# There isn't a single `set_macro_spacing` command like this.
# It's usually handled by the placer's rules.

# Set a halo region around each macro
# Define a halo of 5 um around each macro
# This is also a placement constraint.
# Use `set_macro_halo` if available, otherwise it's placer configuration.
# Assuming `set_macro_halo` exists or is a conceptual command.
# A more standard approach might involve writing a DEF constraint file or using Tcl commands translated to Python.
# Let's assume a conceptual command based on the request.

# for inst in app.getBlock().getInsts():
#     if inst.isMacro():

# Due to lack of a direct `set_macro_fence` and `set_macro_spacing` API commands

"Given a gate-level netlist with a clock port called ""clk_i"", read the tech file, lef files, and library files, and set the clock period as 50 ns. Perform floorplan and set the bottom-left location of the bounding box of the die as 0,0 and the top-right corner as 70,70. Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 6,6 and the top-right corner as 64,64. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Place the macros with a bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 32 um,32 um, and the top-right corner as 55 um,60 um. And place each macro at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 20 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0 um, and the y-axis as0. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X3 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.0435 and 0.0817, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 2 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M6. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Perform floorplan and set the bottom-left location of the bounding box of the die as 0,0 and the top-right corner as 40,60. Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 10,10 and the top-right corner as 30,50. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 15 um,10 um, and the top-right corner as 30 um,40 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. During detailed placement, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After placement, do CTS and use BUF_X2 as clock buffers, then set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After PDN construction, get the IR drop analysis result on M1 layer and dump the def file and name it ""PDN.def"". ","```python
