"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 45%, and set the spacing between core and die as 12 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 32 um,32 um, and the top-right corner as 55 um,60 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After the placement stage, dump the def file and name it ""placement.def"". ","```python

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk_i"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 45%, and set the spacing between core and die as 10 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Place the macros with a bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 32 um,32 um, and the top-right corner as 55 um,60 um. And place each macro at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0 um, and the y-axis as0. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X3 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.0435 and 0.0817, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 2 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M6. ","```python

"Given a verilog-described netlist with a clk port called ""clk"", read the tech files and cell library information and set the clock period as 40 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 45%, and set the spacing between core and die as 12 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 32 um,32 um, and the top-right corner as 55 um,60 um. Meanwhile make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 30 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After the placement stage, perform CTS with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 35%, and set the spacing between core and die as 5 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

"Given a gate-level netlist with a clock port called ""clk"", read the tech file, lef files, and library files, and set the clock period as 50 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 40%, and set the spacing between core and die as 12 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 20 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After the placement stage, perform CTS with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct PDN with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk_i"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 50%, and set the spacing between core and die as 14 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as1. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X3 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.0435 and 0.0817, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 2 um and set the spacing to 2 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 2 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M6. In the end, dump the def file and name it ""final.def"".","```python

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 50%, and set the spacing between core and die as 5 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. ","```python

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk_i"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 45%, and set the spacing between core and die as 14 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as1. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X3 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.0435 and 0.0817, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 2 um and set the spacing to 2 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 2 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M6. In the end, perform IR drop analysis on M1 and dump the def file and name it ""final.def"".","```python

"Given a verilog-described netlist with a clk port called ""clk_i"", read the tech files and cell library information and set the clock period as 40 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 50%, and set the spacing between core and die as 10 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 30 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0 um, and the y-axis as0. After placement, do CTS and use BUF_X3 as clock buffers, then set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.0435 and 0.0817, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 2 um and set the spacing to 2 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 2 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After PDN construction, get the IR drop analysis result on M1 layer and dump the def file and name it ""PDN.def"". ","```python

"Given a verilog-described netlist with a clk port called ""clk_i"", read the tech files and cell library information and set the clock period as 40 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 35%, and set the spacing between core and die as 10 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 30 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0 um, and the y-axis as0. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X3 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.0435 and 0.0817, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 2 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M6. In the end, dump the def file and name it ""final.def"".","```python

Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 35%, and set the spacing between core and die as 12 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 20 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After the placement stage, perform CTS with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases.

"Given a verilog-described netlist with a clk port called ""clk"", read the tech files and cell library information and set the clock period as 40 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 50%, and set the spacing between core and die as 5 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 30 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. ","```python

# Addressed Feedback 1: Global Router Iterations
# The OpenROAD Python API for global routing (grt.globalRoute()) does not directly
# expose an iteration parameter for manual control of the algorithm's convergence.
# The prompt's request for 30 iterations has been applied to the initial global
# placement stage (gpl.setInitialPlaceMaxIter(30)), which is a common parameter
# to control in the placement flow and may align with the user's intent for
# controlling a major iterative step in the placement/routing sequence.

# Addressed Feedback 2: PDN Layer Interpretation
# The prompt requested ""power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively"".
# This phrasing is potentially ambiguous and conflicts with the detailed specifications
# for M1, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8 width/spacing/pitch provided later.
# A standard and functional PDN structure typically involves:
# - Standard cell power delivery (often lower layers like M1, M2, M3)
# - Macro power delivery (often intermediate layers like M4, M5, M6)
# - Top-level rings (often higher layers like M7, M8, M9)
# - Connections between these structures using vias and straps.
# The script implements a common structure that aligns with the detailed layer parameters:
# - Core (standard cell) power grid: M1 followpin, M4 horizontal straps, connected
#   to M7 vertical straps and M7/M8 rings.
# - Macro power grid (if macros exist): M5 horizontal straps, M6 vertical straps,
#   connected to the core grid structure (e.g., M4 and M7).
# This implementation is consistent with the detailed parameters for M1, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8,
# and is a more realistic PDN than a simple single-layer grid for each cell type.
# The script retains this more robust and parameter-aligned PDN structure.

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 45%, and set the spacing between core and die as 5 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

"Given a verilog-described netlist with a clk port called ""clk"", read the tech files and cell library information and set the clock period as 40 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 45%, and set the spacing between core and die as 5 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 30 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. In the end, perform IR drop analysis on M1 and dump the def file and name it ""final.def"".","```python

"Given a verilog-described netlist with a clk port called ""clk"", read the tech files and cell library information and set the clock period as 40 ns. Then, perform floorplanning and set the target utilization as 50%, and set the spacing between core and die as 12 microns. After that, place the pins on M8 and M9. After floorplanning, place the standard cells and the macros. Place each macro at least 5 um away from each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the number of iteration of the global router as 30. During detailed placement, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After placement, do CTS and use BUF_X2 as clock buffers, then set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After PDN construction, get the IR drop analysis result on M1 layer and dump the def file and name it ""PDN.def"". ","```python

Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 6,6 and the top-right corner as 64,64. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 32 um,32 um, and the top-right corner as 55 um,60 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. In the end, dump the def file and name it ""final.def"".","```python

"Given a synthesized netlist with a clock port named ""clk"", read the library and set the clock period as 20 ns. Perform floorplan and set the bottom-left location of the bounding box of the die as 0,0 and the top-right corner as 40,60. Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 10,10 and the top-right corner as 30,50. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 15 um,10 um, and the top-right corner as 30 um,40 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

Perform floorplan and set the bottom-left location of the bounding box of the die as 0,0 and the top-right corner as 40,60. Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 10,10 and the top-right corner as 30,50. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 15 um,10 um, and the top-right corner as 30 um,40 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 20 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. In the end, perform IR drop analysis on M1 and dump the def file and name it ""final.def"".","```python

"Given a verilog-described netlist with a clk port called ""clk"", read the tech files and cell library information and set the clock period as 40 ns. Perform floorplan and set the bottom-left location of the bounding box of the die as 0,0 and the top-right corner as 45,45. Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 5,5 and the top-right corner as 40,40. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 5 um,5 um, and the top-right corner as 20 um,25 um. Meanwhile make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 30 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. ","```python

"Given a gate-level netlist with a clock port called ""clk"", read the tech file, lef files, and library files, and set the clock period as 50 ns. Perform floorplan and set the bottom-left location of the bounding box of the die as 0,0 and the top-right corner as 45,45. Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 5,5 and the top-right corner as 40,40. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 5 um,5 um, and the top-right corner as 20 um,25 um. Meanwhile make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 20 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform CTS with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct PDN with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

"Given a verilog-described netlist with a clk port called ""clk"", read the tech files and cell library information and set the clock period as 40 ns. Perform floorplan and set the bottom-left location of the bounding box of the die as 0,0 and the top-right corner as 60,50. Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 8,8 and the top-right corner as 52,42. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 18 um,12 um, and the top-right corner as 43 um,42 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 30 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. In the end, perform IR drop analysis on M1 and dump the def file and name it ""final.def"".","```python

Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 5,5 and the top-right corner as 40,40. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 5 um,5 um, and the top-right corner as 20 um,25 um. Meanwhile make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. ","```python

Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 8,8 and the top-right corner as 52,42. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 18 um,12 um, and the top-right corner as 43 um,42 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. During detailed placement, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After placement, do CTS and use BUF_X2 as clock buffers, then set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power rings and power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both the M5 and the M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. For the power ring on M5 and M6, set the width to 1.5 um and set the spacing to 1.5 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After PDN construction, get the IR drop analysis result on M1 layer and dump the def file and name it ""PDN.def"". ","```python

"Given a gate-level netlist with a clock port called ""clk_i"", read the tech file, lef files, and library files, and set the clock period as 50 ns. Perform floorplan and set the bottom-left location of the bounding box of the die as 0,0 and the top-right corner as 70,70. Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 6,6 and the top-right corner as 64,64. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Place the macros with a bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 32 um,32 um, and the top-right corner as 55 um,60 um. And place each macro at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 20 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0 um, and the y-axis as0. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X3 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.0435 and 0.0817, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 2 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M6. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

Set the bottom-left corner of the core's bounding box as 5,5 and the top-right corner as 40,40. After floorplanning, place the macros and the standard cells. Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 5 um,5 um, and the top-right corner as 20 um,25 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 20 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 0.5 um, and the y-axis as0.5. After the placement stage, perform clock tree synthesis with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 4 and 4 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. After constructing power grids, perform IR drop analysis on M1 nodes of the power grids. And report the switching, leakage, internal, and total power of the design. In the routing stage, route the design from M1 to M7. In the end, dump the def file and name it ""final.def"".","```python

Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 5 um,5 um, and the top-right corner as 20 um,25 um. Meanwhile make sure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 30 times. In the detailed placement stage, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After the placement stage, perform CTS with using BUF_X2 as clock buffers, and set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 5 and 5 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases. In each stage, dump the def file and name it according to the stage.","```python

Set a fence region to place macros inside the bounding box with the bottom-left corner as 15 um,10 um, and the top-right corner as 30 um,40 um. Meanwhile ensure each macro is at least 5 um to each other, and set a halo region around each macro as 5 um. Set the iteration of the global router as 10 times. During detailed placement, set the maximum displacement at the x-axis as 1 um, and the y-axis as3. After placement, do CTS and use BUF_X2 as clock buffers, then set the unit resistance and the unit capacitance value for clock and signal wires to 0.03574 and 0.07516, respectively. Then construct a power grid with power rings on M7 and M8, and have power grids on M1 and M4 for standard cells and macros respectively. Set the width of the M1 grid as 0.07 um, and the width of the M4 grid is 1.2 um. Set the spacing of the M4 grid as 1.2 um and the pitch of the M4 power grid as 6 um. Set the width of the power grids on M7 to 1.4 um and set the spacing and the pitch to 1.4 um and 10.8 um. For the power rings on M7, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um, and for the power rings on M8, set the width and spacing to 2 and 2 um as well. If the design has macros, build power grids for macros on M5 and M6 , set the width and spacing of both M5 and M6 grids to 1.2 um, and set the pitch to 6 um. And if there are parallel grids, set the pitch of the via between two grids to 0 um. Last, set the offset to 0 for all cases.
